To only build the code run "make" or "make build" on a terminal console.
To build and execute the test program (binaryTreeTest) run "make run" on a terminal console.
To remove the executable run "make clean" on a terminal console.

on a program's import header. However the file arvore.c must be compiled as well so the implementations of said functions be available.
